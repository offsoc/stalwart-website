E-mail filtering is a crucial part of any modern mail server and, for this reason, we're excited to announce the addition of Milter support to Stalwart Mail Server. This update, driven by user feedback, allows the integration of both new and old Milter filters, supporting versions 2 and 6, which expands the server's capabilities in inspecting, filtering, or modifying emails during processing.

A **milter**, or "mail filter", is an extension to mail servers based on the Sendmail protocol. Milters allow third-party software to access mail messages as they are being processed in order to filter, modify, or annotate them. By using Milters, a mail server can utilize a variety of functionalities such as spam filtering, virus scanning, and other types of mail processing, beyond what is built into the mail server itself. Milters operate at the SMTP protocol level, which means they have access to both the SMTP envelope and the message contents.

This new feature not only responds to our users' needs but also ensures that Stalwart can work seamlessly with any existing setup. Whether you are seeking better spam protection, antivirus measures, or implementing specific processing rules, milter filtering has got you covered.
