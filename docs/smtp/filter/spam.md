# Spam filter

Spam filtering is an essential component of any modern mail server, designed to sift through vast amounts of incoming email to identify and segregate unsolicited or potentially harmful messages. These unsolicited messages, commonly known as spam, not only clutter an individual's inbox but can also pose significant security risks. Efficient spam filtering ensures that genuine, legitimate emails reach their intended recipients, while unwanted or malicious emails are quarantined or discarded.

Stalwart includes a comprehensive Spam and Phishing filter that provides a robust defense against such unwanted emails. This filter is built into Stalwart and consists of multiple Sieve scripts, which allow administrators to effortlessly modify its behavior or introduce new rules to better suit their specific requirements. 

Please refer to the [Spam and Phishing filter](/docs/spamfilter/overview) section for more information on the filter's inner workings.
