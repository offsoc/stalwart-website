# Overview

Stalwart provides administrators with the ability to configure various constraints on message intake and delivery. These limits include **rate limiting**, **quotas**, and **concurrency limits**, offering a comprehensive toolkit to manage the server's performance and security.

By defining these limits, administrators can prevent potential threats such as spam or denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, as well as avoid issues like routing loops that could lead to excessive resource consumption. Additionally, limits help ensure that the mail server does not overwhelm remote hosts or its own local infrastructure, maintaining smooth and reliable operation.

Rate limiting controls the volume of messages or connections allowed over a specific period, mitigating the risk of abuse or resource exhaustion. Quotas enable administrators to set limits on resource usage per user, domain, or account, ensuring fair allocation and preventing misuse. Concurrency limits define the maximum number of simultaneous connections or processes the server can handle, protecting both the local system and remote servers from excessive load.

Through these configurable limits, Stalwart empowers administrators to strike a balance between performance, reliability, and security, ensuring the server operates efficiently in a variety of scenarios.
